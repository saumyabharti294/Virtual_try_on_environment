# Virtual Try-On Clothing Environment

## Project Description

This project aims to create an immersive environment where users can virtually try on new clothes by providing their measurements. The project utilizes Unity, WebAR, and plugins integrated into an e-commerce platform to provide a seamless virtual try-on experience. The primary goal is to allow users to visualize how the clothes will fit and look on their unique body shape before making a purchase.



## Features

1. **Measurement Input**: Users can input their body measurements such as height, weight, chest, waist, and hip measurements. This data is used to create an accurate virtual model of the user's body.

2. **Virtual Clothing Models**: A variety of clothing models, including shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, etc., are available for users to select from. These virtual clothing items are designed to fit and adapt to the user's virtual body model.

3. **Realistic Visualization**: The virtual clothing is rendered in a realistic and visually appealing manner to give users an accurate representation of how the clothes will look on them. Proper lighting, shading, and textures are employed to enhance the realism of the virtual try-on experience.

4. **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the virtual environment by rotating, zooming, and moving the camera angle to view themselves from different perspectives. This allows them to inspect the clothing fit and appearance from various angles.

5. **E-commerce Integration**: The virtual try-on environment is integrated as a plugin within an existing e-commerce platform. Users can seamlessly transition from browsing products to trying them on virtually without leaving the website. This integration ensures a smooth shopping experience for users.

6. **Easy Sharing**: Users can capture screenshots or record short videos of themselves wearing the virtual clothes. These can be easily shared on social media platforms to seek opinions or simply showcase the new look.



## Technologies Used

1. **Unity**: Unity is the primary development platform used to create the virtual environment and render the clothing models. It provides a powerful framework for 3D rendering, interactivity, and physics simulations.

2. **WebAR**: WebAR technology is employed to enable users to access the virtual try-on environment directly from their web browser without requiring the installation of any additional applications.

3. **E-commerce Plugin**: An e-commerce plugin is developed to seamlessly integrate the virtual try-on feature into the existing e-commerce platform. This allows users to browse, select, and purchase clothing items while having access to the virtual try-on capability.

4. **Body Measurement Algorithms**: Algorithms are implemented to interpret user-provided measurements accurately and generate a virtual body model that closely represents the user's physique. These algorithms take into account various factors such as body shape, proportions, and sizing charts to ensure an accurate fit.

5. **Realistic Rendering**: Advanced rendering techniques are employed within Unity to create a visually appealing and realistic representation of the virtual clothing items. This includes implementing realistic lighting, material properties, and texturing to enhance the immersive experience.



## Installation and Setup

To set up the virtual try-on environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: [link_to_repository](https://github.com/saumyabharti294/Virtual_try_on_environment).

2. Install Unity on your development machine, ensuring that it meets the required version specified in the project documentation.

3. Open the project in Unity and import any necessary dependencies or assets specified in the project documentation.

4. Set up the e-commerce platform and integrate the provided plugin. Follow the plugin documentation for detailed instructions on how to integrate it seamlessly into your existing platform.

5. Configure the required APIs and backend services for handling user measurements, clothing models, and virtual try-on functionality. Ensure that the necessary database connections and API endpoints are properly set up and accessible.

6. Customize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) elements
